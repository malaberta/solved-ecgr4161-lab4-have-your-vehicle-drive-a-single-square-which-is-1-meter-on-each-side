<br>
The main objective of this lab is to have your vehicle drive a single square which is 1 meter on each side (four straights and four 90 degree CCW turns).  You will do this:

<ol>

 <li>first with no encoder data used (three trials), and</li>

 <li>second while using encoder data (three trials). This must be accurate within 10 cm (start place to finish place).</li>

</ol>

Videotape your robot traveling each of these two variants of squares <strong>once</strong>.  MARK THE STARTING PLACE on your surface (center the robot on that mark), so I can see how well you travel the distance.
